# HVNT Test
This is Spyro's implementation of the HVNT Test! The implementation followed the given instructions from HVNT as well as added UIToolkit as a means to create a quick HUD for the User.

## Implementation Period
Implementing this example took more than 2 hours due to extensive compilation times when building the game into the phone. However, after some extensive testing, I am confident that there are 0 apparent bugs (unless someone find some).
